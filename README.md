## What is "Generate"?

Generate is a command line tool and developer framework for scaffolding out new GitHub projects using [generators](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/generators.md) and [tasks](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md).

Answers to prompts and the user's environment can be used to determine the templates, directories, files and contents to build. Support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) plugins, and much more.

**For more information**:

* Visit the [generate project](https://github.com/generate/generate/)
* Visit the [generate documentation](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/)
* Find [generators on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/generate-generator) (help us [author generators](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/micro-generators.md))

## Getting started

### Install

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `slush` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [Generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

**Install generate-slush**

Install this module with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate-slush
```

### Usage

Run this generator's `default` [task](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md#default) with the following command:

```sh
$ gen slush
```

**What you should see in the terminal**

If completed successfully, you should see both `starting` and `finished` events in the terminal, like the following:

```sh
[00:44:21] starting ...
...
[00:44:22] finished ✔
```

If you do not see one or both of those events, please [let us know about it](../../issues).

### Help

To see a general help menu and available commands for Generate's CLI, run:

```sh
$ gen help
```

## Tasks

All available tasks.

Visit Generate's [documentation for tasks](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md).

## Usage

```sh
$ gen slush.<generator>
```

`<generator>` is the part of a slush generator name that comes after the `slush-` part.
Slush generators should be installed globally using `npm` before running this generator.

## Examples

```sh
# Run the `slush-angular` generator
$ gen slush.angular

# Run the `slush.express` generator
$ gen slush.express
```
